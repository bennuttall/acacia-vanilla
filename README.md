# Acacia Vanilla

Wordpress Theme for my blog - ```www.bennuttall.com``` - a fork of the Manchester Raspberry Jam Wordpress Theme (Acacia Acuminata) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_acuminata

## Wordpress Theme

This theme is a very minimalist design, with limited Wordpress functionality implemented.

### Issues and bugs

Please report any bugs or other problems in the 'Issues' section of this github repository, explaining the issue as detailed as possible - if it's an issue with the user experience on your computer, state the operating system and browser (maybe test another browser too), if it's a problem on your phone or tablet please state the device model and operating system.

### Pull requests

If you manage to fix a bug, or otherwise improve the user interface, please file a pull request after testing your changes if possible.

### Forks

You call that a fork? *This* is a fork!

Feel free to use this theme as is, or fork it and make your own version to use for your own website. I'd hope you'd keep your source on github too :)

### Why the silly name?

This theme is a plain looking version of the Manchester Raspberry Jam theme 'Acacia Acuminata', which is named for the so-called 'Raspberry Jam Tree' - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_acuminata
